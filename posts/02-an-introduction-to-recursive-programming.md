Recursion consists of a problem with a solution that contains a smaller version of the same problem. In programming, it allows solving the problem by applying the same function several times to a value until finally reaching the result.

Let's see some examples!

## 1. Factorial of a number

The factorial of a number is the function that multiplies the number by each natural number below it.

```js
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
4! =     4 * 3 * 2 * 1

5! = 5 * 4!
```

Here, if we pay attention, we can see that `5!` is `5 * 4!`, so the result is a smaller factorial!

```js
// If
5! = 5 * 4!
// Then
n! = n * n-1!

f(n): factorial of n
f(n) = n * f(n-1)
```

The problem is that this doesn't stop and continues to infinity

```js
f(2) = 2 * f(1)
f(1) = 1 * f(0)
f(0) = 0 * f(-1)
f(-1) = -1 * f(-2)
... to infinity
```

A recursive algorithm needs 2 cases:
-   Base case
-   Recursive case

In this case:
-   Base case: `n = 0`
-   Recursive case: `n > 0`

```python
# @param n >= 0
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * f(n-1)

f(5) # out: 120
f(6) # out: 720  (120 * 6)
```

## 2. Fibonacci

Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1.

```js

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
f(7) = 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
```

- Base case: `n <= 1`
- Recursive case: `n > 1`

```python
# Recursive
# f(n): returns the number for the n position in the sequence
def f(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return f(n-1) + f(n-2)

print( f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6))
# out: (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)


# Interative
# f(n): fibonacci sequence with n iterations
def f(n):
	result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
		result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result

print(f(8))
# out: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```
